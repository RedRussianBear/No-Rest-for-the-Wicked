# No Rest for the Wicked
#### A Story from the Forty-First Millenium

Long is the arm of the Law of the Imperium, and harsh is its Justice. When a man crosses it, he is usually given three choices: 
immediate execution, service in the penal legions, or conversion to a servitor. But for those who are wary and can hear the footfalls 
of approaching justice from afar, there is a fourth option -- run.

While few in comparison to the trillion strong throng of mankind, many still manage to do just this, grabbing what belongings they can, 
boarding the first smuggler, mutineer, or even xenos vessel in sight, and vanishing into the darkness of space. Here, mingling in the 
outer murk with pirates, mutants, savages, xenos, and the deadliest opponent -- the void itself -- many perish. But in the far 
periphery, amidst the dim light of the heathen stars, some have found a new home -- Pilgrim's Dusk.

In this system, bound to a single small, rocky planet in an eccentric orbit about a dying star, the fugitives of the Imperium have 
forged a rugged society of the disgraced, the betrayed, and the damned into a republic of sorts. With few visitors (and few wanted), 
the people of Pilgrim's Dusk work to eek out an existence from the land in brief summer months, before bracing to endure the 
long, harsh winter.

It is in one such winter, in one remote town, far beneath the thick blizzards and biting cold, that our story begins, as three 
strangers meet, and put in motion events that will echo deep through the empty tomb of space.

### History

First charted in the Thirty Fifth Millenium by a patrol squadron of the Imperial Navy after a missed warp jump, Pilgrim's Dusk was 
largely unsettled until the past several decades. About eighty years ago a single warp-driven merchant ship, fleeing Ork pirates, 
jettisoned its escape pods about 2AU from the system, with the survivors landing on the lone planet. About three thousand strong 
(from an original crew of eighteen thousand), they founded a rudimentary outpost on an island in the southern hemisphere at Port Arthur. 
Over the next forty years they worked and multiplied, seeking to once again ascend to the heavens. It was twenty nine years Before 
Present, that, numbering some ten thousand, the castaways activated their first high power radio-antenna, broadcasting on all 
frequencies a call for help. 

'Help' came much sooner than expected. Less than a year later, two vessels, one a renegade noble-turned-pirate, the other a deserted 
Imperial Guard transport, locked in a brutal firefight, both picked up the Pilgrim's Dusk signal on different frequencies. Running low
on supplies and needing a body with a breathable atmosphere on which to make repairs, both ships jumped to the provided coordinates, 
planning to raid.

However, the inhabitants of Port Arthur had planned for the likelihood that many of the ships which may find them after the broadcast 
would not be friendly, and so, while lacking true spacefaring capabilities of their own, had created several quite impressive planetary 
defense cannons from the wreckage of their ship. With this leverage, they were able to peacefully coax the two opponents to the surface 
onto landing clearings prepared just for this purpose, and began talks. After landing, both of the crews, headed by Viscount Arlan de 
Morganne and Colonel Artho Stubbs respectively, were impressed by the relative habitability and vegetation of the planet, with many 
seeing it as a spot for settlement, and others as an advantageous base for further excursions. Negotiating with Chairman Ioan Svetlov, 
representative of the 'natives', they agreed to the *Dominion Compact*, signed on the bridge of de Morganne's namesake starship.

The residents of Port Arthur agreed to stop broadcasting the location of the system, with attraction of further settlers on an 
'invitation' basis from de Morganne, in exchange for aid in both constructing rudimentary spacecraft, and the ability to join either 
de Morganne or Artho's crews in order to seek passage off-world, if they so desired. The new arrivals then proceeded to establish a 
second outpost at Suvla Bay, and those who wished and were permitted to stay began developing the town, and expanding homesteads into
the interior of the continent.

The world now supports a quarter million souls, most in Port Arthur and Suvla Bay, but many also spread across smaller outposts and 
towns, and in lone homesteads. With the crews of de Morganne and Stubbs and further arrivals since, it is estimated that more than 80% 
of the people of Pilgrim's Dusk were born off-world. Daily life for most is either farming, ranching, or mining, with further work in 
commerce and light industry in the large settlements, but all coupled with the lawlessness and daily risk of living on a world of 
pirates, deserters, and vagabonds.

## The Brethren of the Reach
![Flag of the Brethren of the Reach](Flag%20of%20the%20Brethren%20of%20the%20Reach.svg)
The Dominion Compact established *A Fraternal Association for the Furthering of Mutual Interests in the Reach of the Koronus Expanse, 
namely within the System of Pilgrim's Dusk*, or as it is more commonly known, *The Brethren of the Reach* a loose confederal government
for the organization and further rule of Pilgrim's Dusk. Port Arthur would serve as the sole port of landing, and the site of annual 
'Brethren Conclaves'. As de Morganne and Stubbs both preferred to have some distance from the established Port Arthur 'natives' and saw 
potential for expansion on one of the nearby continents, the newly established settlement of Suvla Bay was chosen to serve as a second 
capital, housing the day-to-day domestic administration.

The Compact was brief and reads as follows:

> For the further organization of mutually beneficial terms within the system and upon the world of Pilgrim's Dusk this Fraternal 
> Association of law-giving and enforcement. Said Association shall convene yearly at the close of the harvest season for a period of
> one month to decide affairs. This annual conclave shall consist of:
> 
> 1. One representative for every settlement or township in excess of thirty thousand souls upon the world and its surrounding celestial
>    bodies, selected by local vote, with an additional representative for every thirty thousand souls in excess.
> 2. The captain of every starship in excess of ten thousand crew, with an additional officer for every further ten thousand crew in 
>    excess, selected by the mechanisms of each vessel.
> 3. A further representative for each of those organizations of tradesmen that are deemed necessary and crucial to the advancement of 
>    this association on-world and in the void, with the list of qualifying organizations approved by a joint two-thirds vote of the 
>    aforementioned representatives.
>
> These three bodies will henceforth be referred to as the Brethren on-World, the Brethren in the Void, and the Brethren Artisan 
> respectively, and the Brethren in Congress collectively. A quorum of each shall consist of three-fourths of the members present. 
> Each independently may make what resolutions and acts deemed necessary to advance the interests of this association and its people 
> within their respective spheres by a three-fifths vote, and may make joint resolutions and acts respecting the entire sphere of 
> affairs by a collective two-thirds vote. Each shall additionally select a chief officer to preside over their respective spheres in an 
> executive capacity for the remainder of the year with the authority to carry out and enforce their acts.
>
> None of these bodies, separately or in congress, except by joint unanimous vote shall make any resolution abridging the following  
> guarantees:
> 
> 1. No person shall be compelled to enter any form of service, except if ordered as payment for an overdue and onerous debt, 
>    or unless required by an agent of the law in execution of their duties.
> 2. No trade in forced labor or bound persons shall occur upon the planet surface of Pilgrim's Dusk, and no such service shall be 
>    employed anywhere upon it.
> 3. No person may ever be converted to the state of a servitor, and no trade in or employment of such beings shall occur upon the 
>    planet surface of Pilgrim's Dusk.
> 4. No person shall be compelled to host or supply agents of the law without proper and adequate compensation.
> 5. The right of the people of this association, on-World or in the Void, to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.
> 6. All people of this association accused of a crime shall have the right to a prompt and public trial by their peers.
> 7. No person of this association shall be compelled to enact a sentence upon another.
> 8. Having entered into this association, no person may be stripped of their membership in it and the rights herein mentioned.
> 9. No portion of this Compact shall be construed to indicate the full enumeration of rights held by any person, and all rights and 
>    powers not granted herein exclusively to the Brethren in Congress are to be held by the people.
> 
> And so, for the promotion of amity and mutual interests we do consign ourselves to the terms of this Compact. May we perish in the 
> Void should we fail to abide by it.
> 
> Ioan Svetlov, Chairman of the People's Council of Pilgrim's Dusk
>
> Artho Stubbs, Colonel, Captain of the Free Guardsman
>
> The Honourable Arlan, Vicomte de Morganne, Captain of the Dominion
